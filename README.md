ðŸ§® Fiber Mechanics FEM â€“ Plane Stress Simulation
This project implements a finite element solver in Python to model the plane stress response of orthotropic composite bars under axial loading. The solver incorporates fiber-angle-dependent stiffness transformation and visualizes the resulting anisotropic behavior. Developed as part of a computational mechanics course.
